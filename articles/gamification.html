                <p>Gamification grew from a mix of interacting trends and traditions in interaction design and games. Gamification describes those features of an interactive system that aim to motivate and engage end-users through the use of game elements and mechanics. The two common definitions of gamification in academic research are by Deterding et al.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and Huotari and Hamari<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. The former defines gamification as “use of game design elements in non-game contexts”, whereas the latter defines gamification as a “process of enhancing a service with affordances for gameful experiences in order to support user’s overall value creation.” The key differences are Deterding et al.’s<sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> definition explains how to operationalise gamification (how to apply) and prioritises the game design elements. Huotari and Hamari<sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> is a process description incorporating more than just the system or methods and suggests that the focus should be on the user experience, whatever form the final product might take. Gamification is a process of enriching artefacts with game-design elements in order to positively influence users&#8217;<sup id="fnref3:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref3:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.   </p>

<p>The most common features used in gamified applications–points, badges and leaderboards–are not sufficient in themselves to create a game-like experience. They are in fact only used for interaction and feedback. We should target gamification towards increasing intrinsic motivation generated through three points: autonomy, mastery and purpose. Gamification shouldn’t be reduced to just applying game elements and interactive features, it requires an understanding of users’ needs, social styles, their level of expertise and manner of engagement in the task. User behaviour should be the core driving force for a gamified system. Prioritising elements such as points, badges and leaderboards can undermine the complex series of cognitive, emotional, and social affordances that make games intrinsically motivating and enjoyable to play<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. The design and adjustment of gamified services is thus a complex task that exceeds applying simple point systems, leaderboards and badges<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Although primarily concentrated in education/training, sustainability and healthcare/wellness, gamification is widespread across different domains. Interest in gamification has grown because technology is increasingly harnessed for motivating and supporting people toward various individually and collectively beneficial behaviours<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. Many of the studies on gamification aim to test the effect of the particular features implemented, but rarely do this well. Beyond investigating the effects and benefits, there is still lack of understanding on the predictors of why people use gamified services. An extensive amount of literature is primarily descriptive quantitative studies, which do not offer inferences regarding the data and the effect of the gamification (if any at all). There is perhaps a need for more objective quantitative studies, and qualitative studies that delve into users’ understanding of the topic or the system(s) being investigated. The common criticisms of gamification research in the literature&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of a theoretical framework and&nbsp;constructs.</li>
<li>Failure to use validated constructs which hinders the development of the field and the understanding of these gamified&nbsp;elements.</li>
<li>Failure to test the most effective gamification&nbsp;features</li>
<li>The lack of (appropriate objective&nbsp;measures/research</li>
<li>A one-size fits all approach that doesn’t consider individual differences (although research in this area is&nbsp;growing).</li>
