### My background

I am an "out-going introvert" from Kenya who's been living in Finland for over 10 years. I am relatively calm person with a dream to make the world a better place, but sometimes lacking the fortitude to continuously pursue the dream ðŸ™‚. I enjoy being of service to others and  never pass up an opportunity to help if I can. 

After years of contemplation (and starting and stopping one or two personal blogs), it was about time to have a place to share thoughts, learn, test ideas and along the way maybe educate one or two! 

I earned my <a href= "http://jultika.oulu.fi/Record/isbn978-952-62-1885-4" target="_blank">PHD</a>  in information processing science from the Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu in the Spring of 2018. In July 2020, I started working on a project in collaboration with an Oulu-based [urban planning and design agency](https://navico.fi/etusivu/). An overview of the project [here](https://mattersearthly.co/projects.html).

My research has been about the design of persuasive systems, understanding human behaviour and how technology influences and can be used to change/shape human behaviour for the better. 

My research interests include:
	<ul>
  		<li>Persuasive systems (design) and Gamification </li>
  		<li>Use and adoption of digital services </li>
  		<li>Digital Health </li>
  		<li>Community-wide interventions for sustainable and active mobility</li>
  		<li>Social and Digital Inclusion</li>
  		<li>Understanding users' decision-making processes and psychological aspects of behaviour change</li>
	</ul> 
	 
Other interests:

	<li>Data and content analysis</li>

</ul>

 
### Hobbies

Football has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. As with my dream of making the world a better place, I haven't had the fortitude to pursue football beyond the amateur level and my time is now long gone (if there ever was such a time ðŸ˜Œ). In addition to football and following other sports like athletics, I enjoy playing scrabble and chess, listening to music (at times very loudly), reading (mostly psychological, design and business-related books, but I can pretty much read anything), writing (when the motivation strikes!), occasionally binge-watching tv programmes and generally meeting people.

I also enjoy participating in voluntary activities. I have been part of clubs and associations such as <a href= "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotaract" target="_blank">Rotaract</a> in Kenya and <a href= "https://aiesec.org" target="_blank">AIESEC</a> at the university of Oulu which focus on teamwork, members' personal development and community service. In addition to volunteering for <a href= "https://plan.fi" target="_blank">Plan Finland</a>, <a href= "https://jshercules.com/etusivu/" target="_blank">Hercules Football Club</a> and other organisations throughout the years.
