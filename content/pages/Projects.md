## SEWEB

***Sensors and social web*** - **2013-2014**

The target of the project was to create a basis for future health and well-being services by monitoring human ill-being and supporting behaviour change from an early age. By utilising the latest technology, we can monitor users in their everyday life by collecting sensor data for social web applications in real-time. The social web applications can also give feedback instantly (or even proactively), at very specific moments when users have made good or bad decisions affecting their health and well-being.

## Someletti
***Social media in the Physical Space of Airports and Shopping Malls*** - **2010-2013**


The project examined seamless integration of social media systems to physical spaces, in addition to development of physical spaces with the help of feedback gathered via social media.

In the Web 2.0 era, so-called crowdsourcing principles gained great popularity in participatory design. It is important to understand when and under what circumstances this approach can effectively be used. In the project, methods and indicators that support participatory design were to be developed. These methods will enable users to genuinely participate to the development of new products and/or services.

The other research theme in the **Someletti** project was user persuasion. Especially, motivating customers to provide feedback about the physical facilities and services through new social and virtual channels, and to participate in the development of spaces and the virtual channels by using persuasive technology.

**NB:** My main tasks related to the project were the analysis of the persuasiveness of different social media platforms and comparison of the various platforms.
